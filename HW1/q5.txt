a)
a perceptron is a single layer neural network. It is a binary/linear classifier that takes inputs, attributes weights to them
and passes the sum(a linear combination of the inputs) through an activation function to produce an output. This activation function
is nonlinear. For optimizing these weights to get the perceptron to produce the proper output, you want to minimize the loss function
using gradient descent. 
The perceptron can be applied to the task because it acts as a classifier. You feed the image as an input matrix, and using the 
activation function and weights, tune the weights so that it classifies based on recognition of a single object.

b)
the key components and parameters you would need to define when implementing a perceptron for this image classification task are:
    - input size: what part of the image is being fed in (vectors, individual pixels, blocks, the whole image)
    - bias value b
    - activation function: normally some nonlinear one like signum
    - loss function
    - learning rotate
    - number of epochs: iteration count
    - order: standard vs stochastic gradient descent
    - MSE: minmum standard error, if epoch number not set then use this
